# 💼 Profit Prediction - Machine Learning Model

## 📊 Introduction
In this project, the goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the profit of a company based on various features such as research and development (R&D) spending, administration costs, marketing expenses, and the state where the company operates. By analyzing these factors, we can identify the most important predictors of a company's profitability and create an effective model to forecast future profits.

## 🗃️ Dataset Explanation
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **R&D Spend**: The amount of money spent on research and development activities.
- **Administration**: The amount spent on administrative expenses.
- **Marketing Spend**: The budget allocated for marketing activities.
- **State**: The geographical location of the company (can be one of the states: New York, California, or Florida).
- **Profit**: The profit generated by the company.

## 🎯 Aim
The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the **Profit** of a company based on the features **R&D Spend**, **Administration**, **Marketing Spend**, and **State**. By exploring the relationships between these variables and profit, we will develop a model that can help businesses forecast their profitability under different conditions.

| **KNeighbor Regressor**   | 0.554097   | 18162.21   | 11894.50   |

### 📌 Key Insights:
- **Gradient Boosting** achieved the best performance with the highest R-Squared of **0.944243**, and the lowest **RMSE (6422.39)** and **MAE (5899.01)**.
- **ElasticNet**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso** performed similarly with good R-Squared values around **0.92**, but slightly higher errors compared to **Gradient Boosting**.
- **Random Forest Classifier** and **XGB Regressor** showed strong performance but had higher errors compared to the top models.
- **Extra Trees**, **DecisionTree Regressor**, and **KNeighbor Regressor** demonstrated lower predictive accuracy, making them less suitable for this dataset.

## 🔑 Conclusion
Based on the evaluation metrics, **Gradient Boosting** is the best-performing model for predicting profit in this dataset, offering the highest R-Squared and the lowest errors. Other models like **ElasticNet**, **Ridge**, and **Lasso** are also strong contenders, providing good accuracy with slightly higher error metrics. Models such as **Random Forest Classifier**, **Extra Trees**, and **DecisionTree Regressor** did not perform as well, with lower R-Squared and higher error values. **KNeighbor Regressor** showed poor performance across all metrics.
